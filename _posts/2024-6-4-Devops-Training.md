- **What is kernel and its functions?**
    ---
     - The Linux® kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and 
       its processes.
     - It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.
     - The kernel is so named because—like a seed inside a hard shell—it exists within the 
     - OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it’s a phone, laptop, 
     - server, or any other kind of computer.

  - **What the kernel does**
    ---
     The kernel has 4 jobs:
     1. Memory management: Keep track of how much memory is used to store what, and 
        where.
     2. Process management: Determine which processes can use the central processing 
        unit (CPU), when, and for how long
     3. Device drivers: Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes
     4. System calls and security: Receive requests for service from the processes

- **How to check the kernel version?**
   ---
    - To check kernel function name: --
    - root@localhost ~]# uname -r
    - 5.14.0-284.11.1.el9_2.x86_64
