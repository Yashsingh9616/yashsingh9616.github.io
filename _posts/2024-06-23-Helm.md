 - Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps manage Kubernetes applications. It uses a packaging format 
   called charts, which are collections of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. Helm can be used to install, upgrade, and manage Kubernetes applications.

   - Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, a popular open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications. Helm simplifies the deployment of complex Kubernetes applications by using "charts," which are pre-configured packages of Kubernetes resources.

### Key Concepts in Helm

1. **Chart**: A Helm package containing all the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside a Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Release**: An instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. You can have multiple releases of the same chart, with each release being identified by a unique name.
3. **Repository**: A collection of Helm charts. Repositories make it easy to share charts.

### Components of Helm

1. **Helm CLI**: The command-line interface used to interact with Helm.
2. **Chart**: Contains a set of Kubernetes resource definitions (manifests) that describe the state of your 
     application.
     
   - Components of a chart include:
   
   - **Chart.yaml**: A YAML file containing metadata about the chart.
   - **values.yaml**: Default configuration values for the chart.
   - **templates/**: A directory containing template files that are rendered into Kubernetes manifests.
   - **charts/**: A directory containing dependencies as other charts.
   - **README.md**: A markdown file containing a description of the chart.
   - **requirements.yaml**: A file listing dependencies on other charts.


### Helm Repositories and Charts

- **Public Repositories**: Public repositories, like the Helm stable and bitnami repositories, host a wide range of 
    charts for various applications.
- **Private Repositories**: You can also create and host private Helm repositories, useful for sharing charts within 
    an organization.
