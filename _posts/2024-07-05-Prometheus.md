 - Promethes: 
   - Prometheus is an open source monitoring and alerting tool used to collect differect metrics like CPU usage,  
    memory usage, disk I/O, and network I/O, latency and a lot more from servers, web applications, databases, cloud services, docker containers or even kubernetes cluster including nodes, pods, namespaces, and more.


  - **Key Terms in Prometheus:**

   ---
   
    - (1). Prometheus Server: The core component that collects and stores time-series data through scraping targets 
           (applications, services, servers) using HTTP.

    - (2). Time-Series Database: Stores metrics data with a multi-dimensional data model (metric name and key-value 
           pairs called labels) that enables flexible queries and aggregation.

    - (3). PromQL (Prometheus Query Language): A powerful query language used to retrieve and analyze time-series 
           data stored in Prometheus.

    - (4). Scraping: The process by which Prometheus collects metrics from configured HTTP endpoints exposed by 
           target applications or services.

    - (5). Alerting: Allows defining alerts based on thresholds and conditions, triggering notifications via 
           integrations with external services like Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

    - (6). Exporters: Specialized components that help Prometheus gather metrics from various systems and services 
           that do not natively expose Prometheus metrics.


  - **Exporters in Prometheus:**
    - Exporters are intermediary agents or integrations that allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from systems that 
      don't natively expose them in Prometheus format.

    - (1). Node Exporter: Collects hardware and operating system metrics from Linux and Unix-like systems. It 
           provides metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk usage, network statistics, etc.

    - (2). Exporter for Docker: Collects metrics from Docker containers and the Docker daemon. It exposes 
           information about containers, images, networks, and volumes.

    - (3). MySQL Exporter: Exposes MySQL database metrics like query performance, connections, cache usage, etc., 
           for monitoring and alerting purposes.

    - (4). JMX Exporter: Scrapes Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics from Java applications. It helps monitor 
           JVM performance, memory usage, garbage collection stats, etc.

    - (5). Blackbox Exporter: Probes endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, and ICMP protocols to determine their 
           availability and responsiveness. Useful for monitoring external services.

    - (6). Prometheus Pushgateway: Allows ephemeral and batch jobs to push metrics to Prometheus. Useful for 
           short-lived jobs or jobs that cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus.


  - **Prometheus Workflow:**
   ---

    - (1). Instrumentation: Applications and services are instrumented to expose metrics in Prometheus-compatible 
           formats. This is typically done using client libraries in various programming languages.

    - (2). Configuration: Prometheus is configured to scrape these metrics endpoints at specified intervals. 
           Configuration includes defining scrape targets (IP addresses, hostnames, ports) and scrape intervals.

    - (3). Data Collection: Prometheus server scrapes metrics from configured targets using HTTP GET requests. It 
           collects time-series data based on metric names and labels (key-value pairs).

    - (4). Storage: Collected metrics are stored locally in a time-series database. Prometheus uses a local on-disk 
           storage mechanism optimized for high performance and reliability.

    - (5). Querying: Users can query collected metrics using PromQL. PromQL supports aggregations, functions, and 
           selectors to extract insights from time-series data.

    - (6). Visualization and Alerting: Prometheus integrates with Grafana or its built-in expression browser for 
           visualizing metrics through dashboards. Alerts can be defined based on predefined rules in Prometheus Alertmanager.

    - (7). Monitoring and Scaling: Prometheus itself can be monitored using its own metrics exposed via /metrics 
           endpoint. For scaling, Prometheus supports federation and remote storage integrations.
