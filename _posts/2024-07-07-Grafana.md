 - Grafana:
   - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring, visualization, and analysis of time-series data. It supports 
     multiple data sources, including Prometheus, and provides a rich set of tools for creating interactive and customizable dashboards. Grafana is widely used for visualizing performance metrics and setting up alerting based on those metrics.


 - Features:
   - **Visualization:** Allows users to create, explore, and share dashboards rich in analytics.
   - **Data Source Integration:** Supports various data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, 
       Elasticsearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many more.
   - **Customizable Dashboards:** Users can create custom dashboards to visualize their data using a variety of 
       widgets (e.g., graphs, single stat, tables).
   - **Alerting:** Supports alerting to notify users of issues within their infrastructure.







 - How They Work Together

   - **Integration:** Grafana can use Prometheus as a data source. This allows users to create dashboards in,
       Grafana that visualize the metrics stored in Prometheus.
   
   - **Complementary Roles:** Prometheus handles the collection and storage of time-series data, while Grafana 
       provides powerful visualization and dashboarding capabilities. Together, they form a robust monitoring and observability stack that helps in gaining insights into system performance and health.
