 title: Affinity

With the help of affinity we can define where to schedule pods for running on the bases of certain criteria and conditions. There are different types of affinities you can use to guide the scheduler in making these decisions:


### 1. **Node Affinity**
        
       - - Node Affinity helps you specify rules about which nodes a pod should be scheduled on based on the labels 
           on those nodes.

**Example:**
 
- Imagine you have nodes labeled with type=fast and type=slow. If you want a pod to only run on nodes labeled as 
  type=fast, you can use node affinity to enforce this.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
```
This pod will only be scheduled on nodes labeled with `disktype=ssd`.


### 2. **Pod Affinity**

       - Pod Affinity we can add rules about placing pods close to other pods. This is useful when pods need to be  
         co-located for reasons like low latency.

**Example:**
     
- Suppose you have a frontend pod that needs to run on the same node as your backend pod. You can set up pod 
  affinity to achieve this.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: frontend
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```
This pod will be scheduled on the same node as other pods labeled with `app=frontend`.

### 3. **Pod Anti-Affinity**
       - Pod Anti-Affinity is the opposite of pod affinity. It helps you specify rules about placing pods away from 
         other pods. This is useful when you want to ensure that certain pods do not run on the same node to avoid single points of failure.

**Example:**
- Imagine you have multiple instances of a database pod, and you donâ€™t want them all running on the same node.
  You can set up pod anti-affinity to ensure they are spread out.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: backend
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```
This pod will not be scheduled on a node where other pods labeled with `app=backend` are already running.


# Underlay and Overlay 

In networking, underlay and overlay networks are two concepts often used in the context of network virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN).

### Underlay Network
- **Definition**: The underlay network refers to the physical network infrastructure, including all the hardware 
                  like routers, switches, and the physical connections (wires, cables, etc.).
- **Function**: It provides the basic transport layer, responsible for the actual data transmission between devices.
- **Characteristics**:
  - It is hardware-based and often relies on traditional networking protocols like IP (Internet Protocol).
  - Typically consists of fixed routing and switching configurations.

### Overlay Network
- **Definition**: An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of the underlay network. It abstracts 
                  the physical network to create a logical network that can be more easily managed and configured.
- **Function**: It allows for the creation of virtual networks that can provide isolated and flexible networking 
                environments. This is often used in cloud computing, data centers, and network virtualization scenarios.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Uses virtual or logical constructs, such as virtual switches, virtual routers, and tunneling protocols (e.g., VXLAN, GRE).
  - Offers greater flexibility, allowing for dynamic configuration, scaling, and isolation of network traffic.
  - Helps in implementing features like network segmentation, security policies, and traffic management independently of the underlying physical network.

### Interaction Between Underlay and Overlay
- The underlay network handles the actual data transport, while the overlay network deals with how the data is 
  logically segmented, routed, and managed.
- The overlay network relies on the stability and performance of the underlay network to function effectively.
- Virtual network functions in the overlay can include security, load balancing, and quality of service, which can 
  be managed without altering the underlying physical infrastructure.
