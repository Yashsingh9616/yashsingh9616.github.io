Memcached is an open-source, high-performance, distributed memory caching system designed to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. It stores data in memory for quick access, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch the same data from a database or other data store.

### Key Components of Memcached

1. **Memcached Server**:
   - **Function**: The core component that stores and retrieves data. It handles the caching operations.
   - **Example**: A single instance of Memcached running on a server with a specific IP address and port (e.g., `127.0.0.1:11211`).

2. **Client Library**:
   - **Function**: Software library or API that applications use to interact with Memcached. It helps in setting, getting, and deleting data from the cache.
   - **Example**: Libraries for various programming languages like `libmemcached` (C/C++), `memcached` (Python), or `memcached-client` (Java).

3. **Cache Key**:
   - **Function**: A unique identifier for each cached item. It helps in retrieving or deleting specific items from the cache.
   - **Example**: A key like `user:123` to store or retrieve user data for user ID 123.

4. **Cache Value**:
   - **Function**: The data associated with a key that is stored in the cache.
   - **Example**: The serialized user object or a string like `{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}`.

5. **Expiration Time (TTL - Time To Live)**:
   - **Function**: Defines how long an item should remain in the cache before it is automatically removed.
   - **Example**: Setting TTL to 3600 seconds (1 hour) so that the data is cached for one hour before being purged.

6. **Eviction Policy**:
   - **Function**: Determines how items are removed when the cache reaches its capacity. Memcached uses a least-recently-used (LRU) policy.
   - **Example**: If the cache is full and a new item is added, the least recently used item is evicted to make room.

### Example Usage

**Scenario**: You have a web application that retrieves user profiles from a database. To improve performance, you want to cache these profiles.

1. **Storing Data**:
   - **Application Code**: 
     ```python
     import memcache
     
     # Connect to Memcached server
     client = memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'])
     
     # Store user profile data in cache
     user_id = 123
     user_profile = {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}
     client.set(f"user:{user_id}", user_profile, time=3600)  # Cache for 1 hour
     ```

2. **Retrieving Data**:
   - **Application Code**:
     ```python
     # Retrieve user profile data from cache
     cached_profile = client.get(f"user:{user_id}")
     
     if cached_profile:
         print("Cache hit:", cached_profile)
     else:
         print("Cache miss")
         # Fetch from database and cache it
     ```

3. **Deleting Data**:
   - **Application Code**:
     ```python
     # Delete user profile data from cache
     client.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
     ```

### Services and Features

- **High Availability**: Multiple Memcached servers can be used in a distributed setup to provide redundancy and  
    increased capacity.
- **Scalability**: Memcached can be scaled horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased load.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools like `memcached-tool` or third-party monitoring solutions can help track the 
    performance and health of the Memcached servers.
