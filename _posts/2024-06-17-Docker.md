 title: Docker
---
 - Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management,
   of applications within containerized environments. Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

  - **Component of Docker**
   ---
    
   - **Docker Daemon**
      - Docker daemon runs on the host operating system. It is responsible for running containers to manage
        docker services. Docker daemon communicates with other daemons. It offers various Docker objects such as images, containers, networking, and storage.

   - **Docker-Client**
      - The Docker client is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interactwith the
        Docker daemon. It provides commands that use the Docker REST API to communicate with the Docker daemon.

      **Docker Client uses Command Line Interface (CLI) to run the following commands -**

       - docker build

       - docker pull

       - docker run


   - **Docker Host**
      - Docker Host is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications. It contains the 
        docker  daemon, images, containers, networks, and storage.

   - **Docker Hub/Registry**
       Docker Registry manages and stores the Docker images.
    
    - **There are two types of registries in the Docker -**

      - Pubic Registry - Public Registry is also called as Docker hub.

      - Private Registry - It is used to share images within the enterprise.

   - **Docker Images**
      - Read-only templates used to create Docker containers.
      - Images can be built using Dockerfiles and stored in repositories like Docker Hub.

   - **Docker Container**
       Lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software.
       Created from Docker images.

   - **Docker file**

    - 1. Create a file named Dockerfile
    - 2. Add instruction in Dockerfile
    - 3. Build dockerfile to create image
    - 4. Run image to create container 

   - **Docker Compose**

      - A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.
      - It simplifies the management of complex applications.                      

    - **Ways to create an images:**
      - 1. Take image from docker file.
      - 2. Create images from docker file.
      - 3. Create images from existing docker containers.

    - **Docker Swarm**

      - Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool.
      - Turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine for scaling and managing services.

  - **Key Components of a Dockerfile:**
    ---

     - **FROM:** Specifies the base image this command must be on top of the Dockerfile.
     - **RUN:** Executes commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results.
     - **MAINTAINER:** Author/Owner Description.
     - **COPY:** Copies files or directories from local system (Docker VM) We need to provide Source, Destination
                 (We cant't download file from internet and any remote repo).
     - **ADD:** Similar to COPY but, it provide a feature to download files from internet, also we extract file at 
                docker images side.
     - **EXPOSE:** To expose ports such as port 8080 for tomcat, port 80 for nginx etc.
     - **WORKDIR:** Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions,
                    that follow it.
     - **CMD:** Execute commands but during container creation.
     - **ENTRYPOINT:** Similar to CMD, but has higher priority over CMD first commands wiil be executed by 
                       ENTRYPOINT  only.
     - **ENV:** Sets environment variables.
     - **ARG:** Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker buildcommand.

    - **Differences between "Docker" and "docker.io"**
       
       - docker
         - "Docker" refers to the Docker platform, which includes the Docker Engine, Docker CLI (Command Line
            Interface), Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and various other tools and components. Docker as a platform provides a comprehensive environment for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
   
       - docker.io
         - "docker.io" often refers to the package name used for Docker in some Linux distributions, particularly 
            in Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. This package is typically available through the default package repositories of these distributions.
