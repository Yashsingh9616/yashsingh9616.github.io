 - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration (container management tools) platform designed to, 
   automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. Originally developed by Google, 
   it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

 - **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes allows you to manage and coordinate multiple containers (such as,
     Docker containers) across a cluster of servers.

   - **Key Features of Kubernetes**

     - Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks: Automate the deployment of application updates and rollback changes in,
       case of failure.
     - Autoscaling.
     - Auto-Healing: Automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes 
       die, and kills containers that donâ€™t respond to your user-defined health check.
     - Load Balancing: Automatically assigns DNS names to containers and distributes client requests across them.
     - Platform Independent (cloud/virtual/physical)
     - Fault Tolerance (node/pode failure)
     - Health monitoring of containers.
     - Batch Execution: Supports batch execution, where Kubernetes manages jobs for running and terminating 
       containers, as well as monitoring their progress.
     - Multi-tenancy: Provides support for multiple users, teams, or projects on a single Kubernetes cluster.

 - **Components of Kubernetes**
   
   - **Master Node Components:**
    
     - Kube-API Server: (For all communications) This api-server interacts directly with user (i.e. we can apply 
       .yml or json manifest to kube-api-server)

     - Etcd: Stores metadata and status of cluster. A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data. 
       It is consistent and highly available.

     - Kube-Scheduler: Watches newly created Pods that have no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.

     - Control Manager: Make sure actual state of cluster matches to desired state.
     
       Two possible choices for controller manager
      
       (1). If K8s on cloud, then it will be cloud-controller-manager.
       (2). If K8s on non-cloud, then it will be kube-controller-manager.

   - **Node Components:**

     - Kubelet: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures containers are running in a Pod.

     - Kube-Proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes. These rules allow network communication to Pods from network 
       sessions inside or outside of the cluster. 

    - Container Runtime: The software that is responsible for running containers. Examples include Docker,
      containerd, and CRI-O.

   - **Pods:**

     - Smallest unit in kubernetes.
     - Pod is a group of one or more containers that are deployed together on the some host.
     - A cluster is a group of nodes.
     - A cluster has atleast one worker node and master node.
     - In kubernetes the control unit is the pod, not containers.
     - Cantnot start containers without a pod.


   - **ReplicaSets:**
     
     - Ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. They maintain the desired 
       number of Pods, even if some Pods fail or are deleted.

   - **Deployments:**

     - Provide declarative updates to applications. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment 
       Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.     

   - **Services:**

     - A service in a Kubernetes is a logical set of pods, which works together. With the help of services, users 
       can easily manage load balancing configurations.

   - **Namespace:**

     - Kubernetes supports various virtual clusters, which are known as namespaces. It is a way of dividing the 
       cluster resources between two or more users.

 - # Examples

   - 1. Basic Pod Deployment
        
---         
        - Objective: Deploy a single container as a Pod.
        - File: pod.yaml

          - apiVersion: v1
            kind: Pod
            metadata:
              name: nginx-pod
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nginx
                image: nginx:latest
                ports:
                - containerPort: 80

        - Command
          - $ kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
          - $ kubectl get pods          

   - 2. Deploying a ReplicaSet

---

        - Objective: Ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running.
        - File: replicaset.yaml

          - apiVersion: apps/v1
            kind: ReplicaSet
            metadata:
              name: nginx-replicaset
            spec:
              replicas: 3
              selector:
                matchLabels:
                  app: nginx
              template:
                metadata:
                  labels:
                    app: nginx
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: nginx
                    image: nginx:latest
                    ports:
                    - containerPort: 80

        - Command
          - $ kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
          - $ kubectl get replicasets

   - 3.  Creating a Deployment

---

         - Objective: Provide declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets.
         - File: deployment.yaml            

           - apiVersion: apps/v1
             kind: Deployment
             metadata:
               name: nginx-deployment
             spec:
               replicas: 3
               selector:
                 matchLabels:
                   app: nginx
               template:
                 metadata:
                   labels:
                     app: nginx
                 spec:
                   containers:
                   - name: nginx
                     image: nginx:latest
                     ports:
                     - containerPort: 80

         - Command
           - $ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
           - $ kubectl get deployments

   - 4. Exposing the Deployment with a Service

---

       - Objective: Expose the application to external traffic.
       - File: service.yaml 

         - apiVersion: v1
           kind: Service
           metadata:
             name: nginx-service
           spec:
             selector:
               app: nginx
             ports:
               - protocol: TCP
                 port: 80
                 targetPort: 80
             type: LoadBalancer

        - Command
          - $ kubectl apply -f service.yaml
          - $ kubectl get services
