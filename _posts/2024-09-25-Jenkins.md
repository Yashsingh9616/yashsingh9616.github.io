### **Jenkins Overview:**

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java. It's widely used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. Jenkins allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications, facilitating faster and more efficient software development processes.

### **CI/CD Pipeline:**

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Code is automatically prepared for a release to production after passing the tests. Continuous deployment means code changes are automatically deployed to production without human intervention.

---

### **Key Components of Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline:**

1. **Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):**
   - The central place where code resides.
   - Jenkins monitors the repository for changes.
   
   **Command to set up Git in Jenkins:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Build Server:**
   - Executes the build scripts (e.g., Maven, Gradle).
   
   **Command for a simple Maven build:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Automation Testing:**
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests are automated.
   
   **Command for running tests (JUnit as an example):**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Artifact Repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory):**
   - Stores build artifacts like `.jar`, `.war` files.

   **Command to upload an artifact to Nexus:**
   ```bash
   mvn deploy
   ```

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploys code to various environments (staging, production) using tools like Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes.

   **Command to deploy using Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t <image_name> .
   docker push <image_name>
   docker run <image_name>
   ```

6. **Monitoring & Notifications:**
   - Monitors the pipeline, logs, and sends notifications (via Slack, email) upon failures.

---

### **Jenkins Architecture:**
1. **Master:**
   - **Role:** Coordinates the execution of jobs (CI/CD pipeline), scheduling builds, monitoring agents, and provides the web interface.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Manage configurations.
     - Schedule jobs.
     - Distribute builds to agents.
     - Monitor build progress and results.

2. **Agent (Slave):**
   - **Role:** Executes jobs that are assigned by the master.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Perform build tasks (e.g., code compilation, testing).
     - Run on different platforms for flexibility.

**Architecture Flow:**
- Developers commit code to the repository.
- Jenkins Master detects the change and assigns the build to the Agent.
- Agent compiles the code, runs tests, and stores artifacts in a repository.
- Results are reported back to the Master, and notifications are sent.

---

### **Jenkins Pipeline Example:**
Jenkins pipelines can be created using either the classic UI or by using a **Jenkinsfile** (scripted or declarative pipelines).

**Declarative Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repository.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
                sh 'docker push my-app'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Build succeeded!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Build failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Common Jenkins Commands:**

1. **Start Jenkins Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

2. **Stop Jenkins Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins
   ```

3. **Restart Jenkins Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart jenkins
   ```

4. **Checking Jenkins Status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status jenkins
   ```

5. **Installing Jenkins Plugins:**
   ```bash
   jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ install-plugin <plugin_name>
   ```

6. **Run Jenkins Job Manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/job/<job_name>/build --user <username>:<api_token>
   ```

### **Example Workflow:**

1. **Developer pushes code to GitHub.**
2. **Jenkins detects changes in the repository** via the Git plugin.
3. Jenkins **builds** the code using Maven.
4. Jenkins **runs tests**.
5. Jenkins **packages the application** (e.g., a Docker container).
6. Jenkins **deploys** the application to a server (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
7. Notifications are sent to Slack if the build passes or fails.



 - # Real-Time Example: CI/CD Pipeline in Jenkins for a Web Application Deployment

Let's walk through a real-world scenario where Jenkins is used to build, test, and deploy a web application in a **staging** and **production environment**. In this example, the application is containerized using **Docker** and deployed to a **Kubernetes cluster**.

---

### **Scenario:**
You are working in a DevOps team, and your responsibility is to ensure that the code from developers is automatically built, tested, and deployed to both a staging and production environment using Jenkins. 

The application is a simple web app written in Node.js, and it will be containerized using Docker and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.

---

### **CI/CD Pipeline Steps:**

#### **Step 1: Source Code Management (SCM)**
- **Jenkins monitors the GitHub repository** for changes (commits or pull requests) in the `main` branch.
- Whenever a developer pushes code, Jenkins automatically detects the change using **webhooks**.

**GitHub Webhook Example:**
- A webhook is configured in GitHub to trigger Jenkins every time code is pushed to the repository.

---

#### **Step 2: Build**
- Once Jenkins detects a code change, it starts the build process.
- The build compiles the Node.js application and **creates a Docker image** of the app.

**Pipeline Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-organization/node-app.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t node-app:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'Build completed.'
        }
    }
}
```

**Commands for Building Docker Image:**
```bash
docker build -t node-app:latest .
docker tag node-app:latest <docker_registry>/node-app:latest
docker push <docker_registry>/node-app:latest
```

---

#### **Step 3: Testing**
- Automated tests are run to ensure the build is successful and the application works as expected.
- You might have **unit tests**, **integration tests**, or **UI tests**.

**Testing Step in Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
stage('Run Tests') {
    steps {
        sh 'npm test'
    }
}
```

**Command to Run Tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

---

#### **Step 4: Docker Image Push to Registry**
- After a successful build and testing phase, Jenkins **pushes the Docker image to a container registry** like Docker Hub or a private registry (e.g., AWS ECR).

**Pipeline Stage to Push Docker Image:**
```groovy
stage('Push Docker Image') {
    steps {
        withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-credentials', passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS', usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER')]) {
            sh 'docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS'
            sh 'docker push <docker_registry>/node-app:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 5: Deploy to Staging Environment**
- Jenkins deploys the newly created Docker image to the **staging environment** in a Kubernetes cluster.
- The deployment is handled via **kubectl** commands or using a tool like **Helm**.

**Kubernetes Deployment in Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
stage('Deploy to Staging') {
    steps {
        withKubeConfig(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig-credentials') {
            sh 'kubectl set image deployment/node-app node-app=<docker_registry>/node-app:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
        }
    }
}
```

**Command to Deploy to Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl set image deployment/node-app node-app=<docker_registry>/node-app:latest
```

---

#### **Step 6: Manual Approval for Production**
- After the deployment to the staging environment is successful, there might be a **manual approval step** in Jenkins before deploying to the production environment.
- This ensures that the staging deployment is verified by a QA team.

**Approval Stage in Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
stage('Approval for Production') {
    input {
        message "Deploy to Production?"
        ok "Proceed"
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 7: Deploy to Production Environment**
- Once the manual approval is granted, Jenkins triggers the deployment to the **production environment**.
- This step could be the same as the deployment to staging but pointed to the production Kubernetes cluster.

**Deploy to Production Stage:**
```groovy
stage('Deploy to Production') {
    steps {
        withKubeConfig(credentialsId: 'prod-kubeconfig') {
            sh 'kubectl set image deployment/node-app node-app=<docker_registry>/node-app:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 8: Notifications**
- After the deployment is complete, Jenkins can send **notifications** via **Slack** or **email** to inform the team of the successful deployment.

**Slack Notification in Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
post {
    success {
        slackSend channel: '#devops', message: "Successfully deployed to production!"
    }
    failure {
        slackSend channel: '#devops', message: "Deployment failed."
    }
}
```

---

### **Commands Recap:**
1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
   ```
   
2. **Building Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t node-app:latest .
   ```

3. **Pushing Docker Image to Registry:**
   ```bash
   docker tag node-app:latest <docker_registry>/node-app:latest
   docker push <docker_registry>/node-app:latest
   ```

4. **Deploying to Kubernetes:**
   ```bash
   kubectl set image deployment/node-app node-app=<docker_registry>/node-app:latest
   ```

5. **Running Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

---

### **Summary of the Real-Time Example:**
In this scenario, Jenkins automates the entire CI/CD process:
- **Code** is built and containerized.
- **Tests** are run automatically.
- Docker images are pushed to a registry.
- The application is **deployed** to a **staging** environment first, followed by manual approval for deployment to **production**.
- The team is notified of the deployment status through **Slack**.
