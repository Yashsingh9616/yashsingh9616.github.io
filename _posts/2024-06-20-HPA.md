 title: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler(HPA)
---

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a feature in Kubernetes that automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment, replica set, or stateful set based on observed metrics, such as CPU utilization or custom metrics. HPA helps ensure that the right number of pods are running to handle the current load on an application, improving resource efficiency and maintaining application performance.

### Key Components and Services of HPA

1. **Metrics Server**:
   - A Kubernetes component that collects resource metrics from the Kubernetes nodes and exposes them via the Metrics API.
   - HPA uses the metrics provided by the Metrics Server to make scaling decisions.
   - Metrics Server must be deployed and configured correctly in the cluster for HPA to function.

2. **HorizontalPodAutoscaler Resource**:
   - A Kubernetes resource that defines the scaling behavior for a set of pods.
   - Specifies the target for scaling, metrics to monitor, and desired behavior when scaling up or down.

### HPA Configuration and Usage

An HPA configuration specifies which deployment, replica set, or stateful set to scale, the target metric for scaling, and the desired state.

#### Basic HPA Example

Here’s a simple example of an HPA configuration that scales a deployment based on CPU utilization:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: example-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

In this example:
- The HPA is targeting the deployment named `my-deployment`.
- It will scale the number of pods between 2 and 10, depending on CPU utilization.
- The target average CPU utilization across the pods is set to 50%. If the average CPU utilization is above 50%, HPA will scale up; if it is below, it will scale down.

### Metrics for Scaling

HPA can scale based on different types of metrics:

1. **Resource Metrics**:
   - Commonly CPU and memory utilization.
   - Monitored directly from the pods' resource usage.

2. **Custom Metrics**:
   - Metrics defined by the user, which can be related to application-specific metrics like request rates or queue lengths.
   - Requires integration with custom metrics providers.

3. **External Metrics**:
   - Metrics external to the cluster, such as metrics from an external monitoring system.
   - Useful for scaling based on real-world traffic or business metrics.

### HPA Scaling Behavior

- **Scale Up**: When the observed metric exceeds the specified target (e.g., average CPU utilization), the HPA increases the number of replicas to handle the load.
- **Scale Down**: When the observed metric falls below the target, the HPA decreases the number of replicas, which can help conserve resources.
- **Cooldown Period**: To avoid rapid scaling changes (flapping), HPA has a default stabilization window that smooths out scaling events, typically 3-5 minutes.

### Advantages of HPA

1. **Resource Optimization**: Automatically adjusts resource allocation based on demand, optimizing cost and resource usage.
2. **Improved Application Availability**: Ensures sufficient resources are available to handle load, maintaining application performance.
3. **Scalability**: Supports scaling for a wide range of applications, from simple web apps to complex microservices architectures.

### Prerequisites and Considerations

- **Metrics Server**: Must be installed and properly configured in the cluster.
- **Resource Requests**: Pods must have resource requests and limits defined for HPA to function based on resource metrics like CPU and memory.
- **Appropriate Metrics**: Choosing the right metrics and setting appropriate thresholds is crucial for effective autoscaling.
- **Application Behavior**: HPA is suitable for applications that can handle scaling and descaling of pods without issues like state loss or connection disruptions.

### Installation of Metrics Server

To use HPA, you must have a Metrics Server installed. Here’s a basic installation example:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

This command installs the Metrics Server using its default configuration.
