 title: Affinity

With the help of affinity we can define where to schedule pods for running on the bases of certain criteria and conditions. There are different types of affinities you can use to guide the scheduler in making these decisions:


### 1. **Node Affinity**
        
       - - Node Affinity helps you specify rules about which nodes a pod should be scheduled on based on the labels 
           on those nodes.

#### **Example:**
 
    - Imagine you have nodes labeled with type=fast and type=slow. If you want a pod to only run on nodes labeled as 
      type=fast, you can use node affinity to enforce this.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
```
This pod will only be scheduled on nodes labeled with `disktype=ssd`.


### 2. **Pod Affinity**

       - Pod Affinity we can add rules about placing pods close to other pods. This is useful when pods need to be  
         co-located for reasons like low latency.

#### **Example:**
     
     - Suppose you have a frontend pod that needs to run on the same node as your backend pod. You can set up pod 
       affinity to achieve this.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: frontend
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```
This pod will be scheduled on the same node as other pods labeled with `app=frontend`.

### 3. **Pod Anti-Affinity**
       - Pod Anti-Affinity is the opposite of pod affinity. It helps you specify rules about placing pods away from 
         other pods. This is useful when you want to ensure that certain pods do not run on the same node to avoid single points of failure.

#### **Example:**
     - Imagine you have multiple instances of a database pod, and you donâ€™t want them all running on the same node.
       You can set up pod anti-affinity to ensure they are spread out.
       
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: backend
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```
This pod will not be scheduled on a node where other pods labeled with `app=backend` are already running.
