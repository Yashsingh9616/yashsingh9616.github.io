 - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration (container management tools) platform designed to, 
   automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. Originally developed by Google, 
   it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

 - **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes allows you to manage and coordinate multiple containers (such as,
     Docker containers) across a cluster of servers.

---

   - **Key Features of Kubernetes**

     - Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks: Automate the deployment of application updates and rollback changes in,
       case of failure.
     - Autoscaling.
     - Auto-Healing: Automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes 
       die, and kills containers that donâ€™t respond to your user-defined health check.
     - Load Balancing: Automatically assigns DNS names to containers and distributes client requests across them.
     - Platform Independent (cloud/virtual/physical)
     - Fault Tolerance (node/pode failure)
     - Health monitoring of containers.
     - Batch Execution: Supports batch execution, where Kubernetes manages jobs for running and terminating 
       containers, as well as monitoring their progress.
     - Multi-tenancy: Provides support for multiple users, teams, or projects on a single Kubernetes cluster.

 - **Components of Kubernetes**
   
   - **Master Node Components:**
    
     - **Kube-API Server:** (For all communications) This api-server interacts directly with user (i.e. we can apply 
         .yml or json manifest to kube-api-server)

     - **Etcd:** Stores metadata and status of cluster. A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster 
         data. It is consistent and highly available.

     - **Kube-Scheduler:** Watches newly created Pods that have no assigned node and selects a node for them to run 
         on.

     - **Control Manager:** Make sure actual state of cluster matches to desired state.
     
       Two possible choices for controller manager
      
       (1). If K8s on cloud, then it will be **cloud-controller-manager.**
     - (2). If K8s on non-cloud, then it will be **kube-controller-manager.**

   - **Node Components:**

     - **Kubelet:** An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures containers are running in a Pod.

     - **Kube-Proxy:** Maintains network rules on nodes. These rules allow network communication to Pods from 
         network sessions inside or outside of the cluster. 

     - **Container Runtime:** The software that is responsible for running containers. Examples include Docker,
         containerd, and CRI-O.

   - **Pods:**

     - Smallest unit in kubernetes.
     - Pod is a group of one or more containers that are deployed together on the some host.
     - A cluster is a group of nodes.
     - A cluster has atleast one worker node and master node.
     - In kubernetes the control unit is the pod, not containers.
     - Cantnot start containers without a pod.


   - **ReplicaSets:**
     
     - Ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. They maintain the desired 
       number of Pods, even if some Pods fail or are deleted.

   - **Deployments:**

     - Provide declarative updates to applications. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment 
       Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

      -  Autohealing and Autoscaling are provided by deployment, if we want to provide zero down time and 
         autoscaling and autohealing then deploy the deployment what happens when we do deployment, it further create an intermediate resource called replica set which is kubernetes controller and replica set creates pod.     

   - **Services:**

     - A service in a Kubernetes is a logical set of pods, which works together. With the help of services, users 
       can easily manage load balancing configurations.

   - **Namespace:**

     - Kubernetes supports various virtual clusters, which are known as namespaces. It is a way of dividing the 
       cluster resources between two or more users.


   - **DaemonSet:**
    
     - In Kubernetes, a DaemonSet is a workload controller that ensures a copy of a pod runs on all or some 
       specified nodes in a cluster.

   - **StatefulSet:**
     
     - StatefulSets are used for applications that require unique, persistent identities and stable, persistent 
       storage.

   - **Ingress:**
  
     - An Ingress in Kubernetes is a collection of rules that allows inbound connections to reach the cluster 
       services. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on hostnames, paths, and other conditions. Ingress abstracts the complexity of exposing services externally and provides a unified way to manage external access to multiple services within a Kubernetes cluster.

      - **Key Components of Ingress**
  
        - Ingress Resource:

          - A Kubernetes object that defines rules for routing external HTTP/S traffic to internal services.
          - Defines the host, paths, and associated backend services.

        - Ingress Controller:

          - A controller that implements the rules defined in the Ingress resources.
          - Watches for changes to Ingress resources and updates the load balancer configuration accordingly.
          - Examples include NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy, and GCE Ingress controllers.

   - # **Calico**

Calico is a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that provides networking and network policy management in Kubernetes clusters. It offers a range of features that help manage and secure network traffic between containers and other workloads.

### Key Features and Services of Calico
1. **Networking**: Calico provides both L3 (layer 3) and L4 (layer 4) networking capabilities, supporting both overlay and non-overlay networking. It uses protocols like BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for efficient routing.

2. **Network Policy**: Calico enables the creation of network policies that control the flow of traffic between pods, namespaces, and external networks. It supports a zero-trust security model, allowing users to explicitly define what traffic is permitted.

3. **Security**: Calico includes features like data encryption (using WireGuard) and integration with existing security tools and frameworks. It allows for fine-grained access control using network policies that can be defined based on various attributes like namespace, pod labels, and IP addresses.

4. **High Performance**: Calico is designed to scale efficiently, capable of handling large numbers of containers and nodes without significant performance degradation. This makes it suitable for large-scale Kubernetes deployments
  
### Authentication

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. The primary goal of authentication is to ensure that the entity requesting access is who or what it claims to be. This process typically involves presenting credentials that the system can validate.

#### Common Methods of Authentication

1. **Password-based Authentication**:
   - The user provides a username and a password.
   - The system checks if the password matches the one stored for the username.

2. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Combines two or more independent credentials for greater security.
   - Factors include:
     - **Something you know**: Password or PIN.
     - **Something you have**: A security token, smartphone, or smart card.
     - **Something you are**: Biometric verification like fingerprints or facial recognition.

3. **Biometric Authentication**:
   - Uses unique biological characteristics like fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial features.

4. **Token-based Authentication**:
   - Involves a token (digital or physical) that proves identity.
   - Commonly used in APIs and mobile applications.

5. **Certificate-based Authentication**:
   - Uses digital certificates issued by a trusted authority to verify identity.
   - Often used in SSL/TLS for secure web communications.

### Authorization

**Authorization** is the process of determining whether an authenticated entity has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. Authorization checks happen after authentication and are crucial for enforcing security policies.

#### Key Aspects of Authorization

1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
   - Define which users or systems can access certain resources and what operations they can perform.
   - Example: Read, write, execute permissions for files and directories.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Assigns permissions based on the roles of users within an organization.
   - Roles are defined based on job functions, and permissions are granted to roles rather than individuals.

3. **Policy-Based Access Control**:
   - Uses policies to manage access to resources.
   - Policies can be based on various attributes, such as user identity, resource type, and environmental conditions.

4. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
   - Uses attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, environmental attributes) to make access control decisions.
   - Allows for more fine-grained access control.

### Example Scenario

Consider an online banking system:

1. **Authentication**: A user logs in by providing a username and password. The system verifies these credentials to authenticate the user.
2. **Authorization**: Once authenticated, the system checks the user's role and permissions to determine what actions they can perform, such as viewing account balances, transferring money, or accessing transaction history.

### Summary

- **Authentication** confirms the identity of an entity.
- **Authorization** determines what authenticated entities are allowed to do.

Both processes are critical in securing systems, protecting data, and ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions or access certain resources.

 - Ensure the nodes are labeled correctly if using node selectors or affinities.
 - Verify there are no taints on nodes that would prevent scheduling.

4. **Node Not Ready**:
 - **Description**: One or more nodes are in a "NotReady" state.
 - **Troubleshooting**:
 - Check node status: `kubectl describe node <node-name>`.
 - Review kubelet logs on the affected node.
 - Ensure the node has network connectivity.

5. **Service Not Working**:
 - **Description**: Services are not accessible or routing traffic correctly.
 - **Troubleshooting**:
 - Check the service and endpoints: `kubectl get svc` and `kubectl get endpoints`.
 - Verify network policies and firewall rules.
 - Ensure the pods backing the service are healthy and running.

6. **Insufficient Resources**:
 - **Description**: Pods cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources.
 - **Troubleshooting**:
 - Review resource requests and limits in pod specifications.
 - Scale the cluster by adding more nodes.

7. **PersistentVolume Claims Pending**:
 - **Description**: PVCs remain in a "Pending" state.
 - **Troubleshooting**:
 - Check if there are available PVs that match the PVC specifications.
 - Ensure the storage class exists and is configured correctly.
 - Verify that the underlying storage backend is healthy.

8. **Pod Stuck Terminating**:
 - **Description**: Pods get stuck in a "Terminating" state.
 - **Troubleshooting**:
 - Check for finalizers that might be preventing pod deletion.
