 title: Container Network Interface
---

CNI, or Container Network Interface, is a specification and a set of libraries for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers. It is primarily used in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to manage network connectivity for containers.

### Key Features of CNI:

1. **Standardization**: CNI provides a standardized way to configure network interfaces, making it easier to integrate with different container runtime environments.
2. **Modularity**: It is designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing for easy integration and customization.
3. **Plugins**: CNI uses plugins to handle network configuration. These plugins can be easily swapped out or extended, offering flexibility in networking solutions.

### CNI Plugins

There are several plugins available for CNI, each providing different networking capabilities. Here are some common ones:

1. **Bridge**: Creates a bridge network and attaches containers to it. This is similar to the default Docker network.
   - **Example**: Connecting all containers on a host to a single bridge, allowing them to communicate with each other.

2. **Calico**: Provides a scalable networking solution with support for network policies, using BGP to distribute routes.
   - **Example**: Implementing network policies to control traffic flow between Kubernetes pods.

3. **Flannel**: A simple overlay network that uses a VXLAN or other tunneling protocol to encapsulate packets.
   - **Example**: Creating a flat network that spans multiple hosts, making it easy for containers to communicate across different machines.

4. **Host-local**: Allocates IP addresses from a local pool for each host.
   - **Example**: Assigning IP addresses from a specified range to containers on a single host.

5. **Macvlan**: Allows containers to have their own MAC address, which can be useful for integrating with existing network infrastructure.
   - **Example**: Attaching containers directly to a physical network, making them appear as unique devices on the network.

6. **SR-IOV**: Provides high-performance network interfaces by allowing containers to directly access network hardware.
   - **Example**: Using SR-IOV for workloads that require high network throughput and low latency, such as high-frequency trading applications.

### Example Usage in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, CNI plugins are used to manage the networking of pods. For instance, when a new pod is created, the CNI plugin is called to configure the pod's network interface, assign an IP address, and set up necessary routing rules.

**Example with Calico:**
1. A Kubernetes cluster is set up with Calico as the CNI plugin.
2. When a new pod is scheduled, Calico assigns it an IP address and sets up routes so that it can communicate with other pods and services.
3. Calico also enforces network policies defined by the user, such as allowing traffic only from certain namespaces or blocking access to specific ports.

This modular and flexible approach allows Kubernetes and other container platforms to support a wide range of networking models and configurations, depending on the needs of the application and infrastructure.


# Container Runtime Interface

CRI, or Container Runtime Interface, is an API specification in Kubernetes that defines how the container runtime should interact with the Kubernetes kubelet, which is the agent responsible for managing the state of containers on a node. CRI allows Kubernetes to support multiple container runtimes through a standardized interface.

### Key Components of CRI

1. **Container Runtime**: The software responsible for running containers. Examples include Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.
2. **kubelet**: The agent running on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, responsible for managing containers according to the Kubernetes control plane's instructions.

### Main Functions of CRI

1. **Container Lifecycle Management**: CRI defines how to start, stop, and manage the lifecycle of containers.
2. **Image Management**: It specifies how to pull, list, and manage container images.
3. **Pod Sandbox Management**: A pod sandbox provides an isolated environment for pod containers, including the network namespace and cgroups.

### Popular CRI Implementations

1. **Docker**: One of the original container runtimes used by Kubernetes. Docker provides both the runtime and image management capabilities.
   - **Example**: Running a web application container using Docker as the runtime in a Kubernetes cluster.

2. **containerd**: A lightweight container runtime that emphasizes simplicity and performance. It's often used as the container runtime for Docker itself.
   - **Example**: Running a set of microservices with containerd as the runtime, providing a more streamlined and resource-efficient alternative to Docker.

3. **CRI-O**: A lightweight container runtime specifically designed to support the CRI interface. It's commonly used with Kubernetes to provide a minimal and secure runtime environment.
   - **Example**: Running an application stack on Kubernetes with CRI-O, offering strong security features and compliance with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards.

### Example Usage in Kubernetes

When a Kubernetes cluster uses a CRI-compatible runtime, the kubelet communicates with the runtime using the CRI API to manage containers and images.

**Example with containerd:**
1. **Pod Creation**: When a new pod is scheduled, the kubelet communicates with containerd to pull the necessary container images and set up the pod sandbox.
2. **Container Management**: The kubelet instructs containerd to start, stop, or restart containers as needed based on the pod's specifications.
3. **Monitoring**: containerd provides status information back to the kubelet, which is then used to report the health and status of pods and containers to the Kubernetes control plane.

The CRI specification ensures that Kubernetes can work with a variety of container runtimes, allowing for flexibility and choice in how containers are managed and executed.
